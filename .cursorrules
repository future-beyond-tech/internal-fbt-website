# FBT Platform Website — Responsive-First & Enterprise Rules

## Role & Objective
You are an expert Next.js frontend engineer specializing in responsive, multi-device UI/UX. Deliver a **zero-friction experience** across Phone (320px+), Tablet (768px+), and Desktop (1024px+). Functionality must remain 100% intact across all breakpoints.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Architecture
- Write base styles for mobile (320px) first.
- Use `min-width` media queries to scale up.
- Never use `max-width` queries as primary logic.

### 2. Touch-First Interactions
- Minimum touch target: **44x44px** (Apple HIG) or **48x48px** (Material Design).
- Hover states must have tap equivalents for touch devices.
- Use `@media (hover: hover)` for hover-specific features.
- Implement `active` states for immediate touch feedback.

### 3. Responsive Layout Strategy
Use these breakpoints consistently (Tailwind defaults):
- `sm`: 640px — Large phones
- `md`: 768px — Tablets portrait
- `lg`: 1024px — Tablets landscape / small laptops
- `xl`: 1280px — Desktops
- `2xl`: 1536px — Large screens

### 4. Flexible Components Pattern
- **Container queries** where component-specific responsiveness is needed.
- **CSS Grid** for 2D layouts (dashboards, cards).
- **Flexbox** for 1D layouts (navigation, lists).
- **clamp()** for fluid typography and spacing.

## Code Structure Requirements

### Component Template
- Use `'use client'` only when the component needs client-side state or effects.
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes.
- Use `useMediaQuery` from `@/hooks/use-media-query` for conditional rendering only when necessary.
- Base: mobile styles first; then `md:` and `lg:` for tablet and desktop.
- Include touch optimizations: `touch-manipulation`, `select-none`, `active:scale-[0.98]`, `transition-transform`.

### Form Elements (Critical for UX)
- Mobile: larger inputs for thumb typing (e.g. `h-12 text-base px-4`).
- Tablet/Desktop: `md:h-10 md:text-sm`.
- Use `text-base` on mobile to prevent zoom on iOS; scale down with `md:text-sm`.
- Always set `inputMode` where appropriate: `email`, `tel`, `numeric`, `search`.
- Focus: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2`.

### Navigation Patterns
- Mobile: fixed bottom or top nav; consider bottom sheet or hamburger.
- Tablet+: static sidebar or collapsible sidebar.
- Use fixed + full width on mobile; `md:static md:w-64 md:h-screen` (or similar) on larger screens.

## Critical UX Rules

### Viewport
- Prevent horizontal scroll: `overflow-x: hidden`, `max-width: 100vw` on html/body where needed.
- Safe areas: use `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notched devices (padding-top/bottom/left/right).

### Performance
- Use `will-change` sparingly, only on animated elements.
- Prefer `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen content where appropriate.
- Lazy load below-fold images: `loading="lazy"`.
- Use `IntersectionObserver` for scroll-triggered features.

### Accessibility
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content where it changes meaning.
- Focus management for modals/drawers: trap focus, restore focus on close.
- WCAG 2.1 AA: contrast, focus indicators, touch target size, labels.

---

## Responsive Data Tables
- Mobile: card layout (stack fields vertically per row).
- Desktop: traditional `<table>`.
- Use `md:hidden` for mobile-only block and `hidden md:block` for table block.

---

## Image & Media
- Prefer `<picture>` with `source` for different breakpoints/sizes.
- Use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` on images.
- Class: `w-full h-auto object-cover` (or appropriate object fit).

## Testing Checklist (Mental Model)
Before submitting code, verify:
- Works at 320px (e.g. iPhone SE).
- Works at 768px (e.g. iPad portrait).
- Works at 1024px (e.g. iPad landscape).
- Touch targets ≥ 44px.
- No horizontal scroll.
- Text readable without zoom (16px+ base on mobile).
- Forms usable with virtual keyboard open.
- No hover-only features without tap fallback.
- Images do not overflow containers.
- Modals/drawers respect safe areas.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Tailwind CSS**: utility-first responsive styling (v4 in this project).
- **shadcn/ui**: use as base component patterns when introduced; keep consistency.
- **Framer Motion**: optional for gesture-based interactions.
- **useMediaQuery**: `@/hooks/use-media-query` for JS-based responsiveness.
- **Container Queries**: for component-level responsiveness when needed.

---

## Output Rules
1. Provide complete, working component code.
2. Include TypeScript interfaces.
3. Add JSDoc for non-obvious responsive logic.
4. Never use `!important` in Tailwind.
5. Use `cn()` for conditional classes.
6. Export named and/or default as appropriate.

---

## FBT Enterprise Constraints
- Use **Tailwind CSS** exclusively for styling (no CSS-in-JS).
- Follow **shadcn/ui** component patterns when using or adding UI primitives.
- **Zero-friction UX**: users should never feel difficulty across devices.
- Support **offline-first** where possible (e.g. localStorage with sync).
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- Use **Next.js App Router** patterns (app directory, server/client components as appropriate).
- **Loading states** for all async operations.
- Prefer **skeleton screens** over spinners where possible.

## How to Use in Cursor
- These rules apply to all frontend work in this repo.
- For specific components, you can say: "Follow the responsive-first guidelines. Create a [component name] that works seamlessly on phone, tablet, and web without breaking functionality."
